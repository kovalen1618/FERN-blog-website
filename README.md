---------- React ----------

_react-router-dom_ is an npm package that enables you to implement page routing in a web app so that users can easily navigate between and view the pages.

It is used for single-page applications: apps that do in fact have many pages or components but are never refreshed - instead their content is dynamically fetched based on the URL through the process of Routing - made possible with the help of react-router-dom.

<code>npm install react-router-dom</code>

---------- Local Storage ----------

How does local storage work?

---------- useState ----------

What is useState?

Why write useState("")?

---------- Database ----------

Why does storing data have to be asynchronous?

On the **Firestore Database** a **collection** is a data-table and a **document** is a data entry.

The Firestore Database is a **NoSQL** database.

Make sure within the **Rules** tab of your Cloud Firestore that read, write is set to true in order to alter the database (i.e. POST, DELETE, etc.)
