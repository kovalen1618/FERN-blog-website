---------- React ----------

_react-router-dom_ is an npm package that enables you to implement page routing in a web app so that users can easily navigate between and view the pages.

It is used for single-page applications: apps that do in fact have many pages or components but are never refreshed - instead their content is dynamically fetched based on the URL through the process of Routing - made possible with the help of react-router-dom.

<code>npm install react-router-dom</code>
